### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Jake and I'm a student developer at Swarthmore College and an AI ethcis research affliated with McGill Universities Responsible Autonomy & Intelligent System Ethics (RAISE) Lab. 

Feel free to click through [my website](jakec007.github.io) for more on me and what I do. 

### A snapshot of Jake (last updated Sept. 4, 2020)
- I'm current working on wrapping up `3` research papers
- I'm starting to apply to PhD programs. If you know anyone cool who works in any of the following fields drop me a line. I'm on the lookout for cool people and interesting labs to work with:
  * HCI
  * Tech Ethics & Policy 
  * CS Pedagogy
- I just joined [Octo ring](https://octo-ring.com/) which seems pretty neat--see the widget below
