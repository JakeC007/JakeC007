### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Jake. I'm a CS PhD student at The University of Chicago working under [Marshini Chetty](https://www.marshini.net/) in the [Amyoli Internet Research Lab](https://airlab.cs.uchicago.edu/). Broadly, I'm interested in HCI, ethics and tech policy. 

Feel free to click through [my website](https://jakec007.github.io/) for more on me and what I do.

- My paper Uncovering Privacy and Security Challenges In K-12 Schools was accepted to CHI23! [Here is the DOI which should be live soon-ish!]( https://doi.org/10.1145/3544548.3580777)
- I'm spinning up a new project!
